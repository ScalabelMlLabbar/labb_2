### (b) data-centric approach

To get better results, on our domain task, gen Z slang, we can shift our focus from just tweaking the model's settings to actually improving the data it learns from. This is a datacentric aprotche. The problem right now is that standard models are trained on formal, static text, so they often just guess when they encounter real-world slang. By finding and feeding the model fresh, raw datasets that capture these more casual areas. This can help the model performance on this specific task.
